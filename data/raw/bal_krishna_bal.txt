I am currently Professor of Computer Engineering and Associate Dean - Research, Projects, Extended Programs (July 29, 2024 - July 28, 2026) at the School of Engineering, Kathmandu University. Earlier, I served as the Head at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Kathmandu University(KU) from October 2018 till July 29, 2024. I completed my Bachelors and Masters Degrees in Informatics and Computer Engineering from Russia, respectively in the year 2002 and 2004. Similarly, I completed my PhD from Kathmandu University in the year 2015. I joined Kathmandu University in 2009. Before that I was working at Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya, Nepal in two of the Language Technologies Projects, namely the the Bhasha Sanchar Project(2005-2007) and PAN Localization Project (2005-2009). My primary research area is Natural Language Processing(NLP) and I am in the field since 2005. I have worked both in the industry and the academia conducting various Research and Development of NLP applications like the Spellchecker, Grammar checker, Machine Translation, Text-to-Speech, Optical Character Recognition(OCR), Sentiment Analysis etc. Besides NLP, I also have significant industrial experiences on Software Localization. I have been involved with multi-national software localization Projects like PAN Localization, http://panl10n.net and am currently providing consulting services to software giants for developing localized software and content.
